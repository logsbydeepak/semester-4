4. Program to swap two number and display number before swapping and after swapping [program](./A/04-swap-numbers.py)
5. Write a program in python, that calculates the volume of a sphere with radius r entered by the user. (Assume π = 3.14) [program](./A/05-volume-of-sphere.py)

## B Conditional Statements
1. Write a program to check whether an entered year is leap or not. [program](./B/01-leap-year.py)
