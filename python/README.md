# Python

## A Basic
1. Write a program to demonstrate different number data types in Python [program](./A/01-data-types.py)
2. Write a program to perform different Arithmetic Operations on numbers in Python [program](./A/02-arithmetic-operations.py)
3. Program to create random number generator which generate random number between 1 and 6 [program](./A/03-random-number-generator.py)
4. Program to swap two number and display number before swapping and after swapping [program](./A/04-swap-numbers.py)
5. Write a program in python, that calculates the volume of a sphere with radius r entered by the user. (Assume π = 3.14) [program](./A/05-volume-of-sphere.py)

## B Conditional Statements
1. Write a program to check whether an entered year is leap or not. [program](./B/01-leap-year.py)

4. Write a program that reads roll no. from a student. Then your program should display a message indicating whether the number is even or odd [program](./B/04-even-odd.py)
5. Let us say a teacher decided to give grades to her students as follows: [program](./B/05-grades.py)
   a) Mark greater than or equal to 80: Excellent
   b) Mark greater than or equal to 65 but less than 80: Good
   c) Mark greater than or equal to 50 but less than 65: Pass
